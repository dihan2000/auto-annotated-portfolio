Traveling the world on a budget is possible with smart planning and cost-saving strategies. **Choose budget airlines, travel during off-peak seasons, and use travel reward programs** for cheaper flights. **Stay in hostels, guesthouses, or try couchsurfing** to save on accommodation. **Use public transportation, walk, or rent bikes** instead of taxis or private cars. **Eat local street food and cook occasionally** to cut food expenses while enjoying authentic flavors.
